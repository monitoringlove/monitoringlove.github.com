You say you want to contribute to an Open Source project, but you're not sure where to start? Have an interest in monitoring, trending or logging software? Hop on over to the Monitorama [Hackathon issues](https://github.com/monitorama/hackathon/issues) list and take a look around. In the weeks leading up to the event we seeded the repo with a bunch of tasks/feature requests/bug reports that are easily digestible over the course of a day or two. These are a great place to get started on a new project, or nail out some quick issues that have an immediate impact.

We even went to the trouble of labeling all of the issues so it's really easy to filter by the project name and see what's available. If you want to see the competition entries and winners, just filter by labels such as [Judging](https://github.com/monitorama/hackathon/issues?labels=Judging), [1st Place](https://github.com/monitorama/hackathon/issues?labels=1st+Place), or [Runner Up](https://github.com/monitorama/hackathon/issues?labels=Runner+Up). Most of the issues link to a corresponding issue under their respective project repositories, so you'll probably want to focus your work there instead, but having them all available under a single repo makes a great "jumping off" point.
